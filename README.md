# Homework 1: ANN Function Learning

## Overview
This project is part of the ECEN935 Computational Intelligence course for Fall 2024. It focuses on 
implementing and analyzing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Specifically, the assignment requires
training a feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) using an appropriate training dataset and the
backpropagation algorithm to learn the function y = 2x<sup>2</sup>+1 for x=[-1,1].

```

## Requirements
- Matlab (R2024b was used but not necessarily required)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Make new directories: figures/ and models/
3. Install Matlab if not already installed

## Usage
The bulk of the functionality is implemented in mlp_layer.m and multilayer_perceptron.m

The script main.m will generate the necessary data for the quadratic function, perform
train-test splits, train the model, and evaluate on the test set. The main.m script will also
record MSE results and necessary plots to disk.
